# Dimensional Data Modelling with dbt

### Info

A dimensional data modeling application suitable for various business needs was implemented using the Northwind Traders database prepared by Microsoft.

Respectively
Conceptual -> Logical -> Physical
The modeling stages were drawn through draw.io and the physical implementation was realized through dbt.

I've buildid this model at WSL and used virtual enviroment.
